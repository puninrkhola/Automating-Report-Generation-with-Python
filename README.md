Manually creating reports from raw data is time-consuming and prone to errors. To solve this, I developed an Automated Report Generator using Python and FPDF, which processes CSV files and converts them into well-structured PDF reports.

This project helped me explore file handling, object-oriented programming, and data automation in real-world applications.
